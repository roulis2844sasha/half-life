Background: An Asian National Peace Summit is
about to occur in downtown Tokyo. Terrorists have
opted to target the sprawling Tokyo subway line in 
the early morning before the conference in an attempt
to cause confusion and halt the international meeting.

Terrorists: Destroy one of two points within 
the Shinkane Subway Station to prevent the 
Peace Summit from taking place.  

Counter-Terrorists:  Protect the Subway Station from 
damage and insure that the Peace Summit occurs.
