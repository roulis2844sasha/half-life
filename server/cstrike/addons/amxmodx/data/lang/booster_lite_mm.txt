Info:
 - Booster-Lite replaces hlds Sleep function with 'NetSleep' function that
   stops sleeping if hlds receives network packet from client. This lowers
   ping about 10-15ms.


Settings:
 - With booster_lite_mode you can select which sleeping mode booster uses.
     
   * Mode 0: Server sleeps 10ms if no network packets are received. If server
     receives network packet server stops sleeping. If you want this version of
     Booster-Lite work as version 1.00 use this mode.
     
   * Mode 1: Server first tries to sleep 10ms. If network packet is received
     server stops sleeping. Otherwise server tries to sleep another 10ms. This
     mode uses less CPU than mode 0.
     
   * Mode 2: Server tries to sleep 50ms. If server receives network packet
     server stops sleeping. This mode uses less CPU than mode 0.
     
   * Mode 3: Disables Booster-Lite. Server sleeps 10ms between every frame
     even if network packets have been arraived.
     
 - With booster_lite_extra_sleep_frequency you can force server to sleep 
   even if network packet is received. Setting value of cvar to 10 makes 
   server sleep 10ms for every 10th skipped sleep. This setting is for 
   lowering CPU usage.


Installing:
 1. You need Metamod.
